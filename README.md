# dotfiles

My personal dotfiles, published here mainly for my own convenience.

`init.sh` will create the required symbolic links (run with `-f` to overwrite existing files).

Of note is the `sd` script included in `.local/bin`, whose concept is courtesy of [Ian Henry][1]. The corresponding
scripts are provided in `.sd`.
